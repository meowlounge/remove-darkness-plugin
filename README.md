# Remove-Darkness Plugin

A lightweight **Paper plugin** that disables Minecraft’s *darkness visual effect* for players who choose to opt out — perfect for **multiplayer servers**.

---

## ⚠️ Usage Notice

This plugin is designed **for servers only**.
If you want the same feature in **singleplayer**, use the **[Fabric Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/rde)** instead.

Installing both the mod and the plugin is unnecessary.
Each version is made for its own environment — **client mod for singleplayer, plugin for servers**.

---

## 🧩 Overview

**Remove-Darkness Plugin** removes the “darkness” screen overlay that appears in low-light areas or when affected by the *Darkness* potion or Warden ability.
It does **not** alter lighting, gameplay mechanics, or other players’ experiences — only the **visual overlay** for the player who opts out.

* Players can toggle the effect **allow / deny / status** via `/darkness` command
* Saves each player’s preference automatically
